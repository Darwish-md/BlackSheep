1- name the tables so the names don't clash like order, user, etc as mysql have these as reserve keywords.
2- whenever posting in controllers, use redirect:/{html page name}
3- dependencies have to match in versions
4- lazy fetching didn't work, so we used eager. 
5- everytime we open the IDE we should pull the gitHub repo first before editing the project so that we can push to gitHub. that's because we may have edited the code or added files online
  GitHub does't accept push requests if the local repository is outdated.
